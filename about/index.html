			    <h1>About the comic</h1>
			    <p>
			        Crawlspace is a short, serialized webcomic about independence, courage, and things that go bump in the night.
			        It is being written primarily as a learning experience, and for personal enjoyment, so both the artistic quality and writing is likely to be very rough at times.
			        You can learn more about the comic's licensing and how to get the source code for this site by clicking the Github link at the top of the page.
			    </p>
			    <p>
			        Parents and younger readers should know that Crawlspace is a light horror story that will include some mature content, including violence, references to alcohol, and tense or threatening situations.
			        In order to make the comic accessible to as many readers as possible, an optional swearing filter will soon be made available at the top of the page.
